<H1>PHP3 Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

<!-- The website should stop chopping. -->


<P>This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about PHP3 and
their answers. If you have suggestions or additions, send them to
<CODE>php3@php.il.eu.org</CODE>.

<HR>

<H2>General Information</H2>

<H3>What is PHP3?</H3>

<P>From the <A href="http://www.php.net/manual/manual.html">manual</A>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Professional Home Pages Version 3.0 is an HTML-embedded scripting
language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a
couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language
is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>What is its relation to PHP/FI?</H3>

PHP3 is the successor to PHP/FI 2.0.

<H3>What are the differences between PHP3 and PHP/FI 2.0?</H3>

<P>For a complete list of the changes, read the <a href="changes.php3">CHANGES</a>
file included in the PHP3 distribution. Some highlights:

<UL>
  <LI>All-new parser.
  <LI>Persistent database connections.
</UL>

<H3>Is there a PHP3 mailing list?</H3>

<P>Of course! To subscribe, send mail to
<CODE>php3-subscribe@php.il.eu.org</CODE>. You don't need to include
anything special in the subject or body of the message.

<P>To unsubscribe, send mail to
<CODE>php3-unsubscribe@php.il.eu.org</CODE>.

<H3>Help! I can't seem to subscribe to the mailing list!</H3>
<H3>Help! I can't seem to unsubscribe from the mailing list!</H3>

<P>If you have problems subscribing to or unsubscribing from the PHP3
mailng list, it may be because the mailing list software can't figure
out the correct mailing address to use. If your email address was
<CODE>joeblow@example.com</CODE>, you can send your subscription request
to <CODE>php3-subscribe-joeblow=example.com@php.il.eu.org</CODE>,
or your unsubscription request to
<CODE>php3-unsubscribe-joeblow=example.com@php.il.eu.org</CODE>.

<H3>Is there an archive of the mailing list anywhere?</H3>

<P>Yes, it's located at <A
href="http://www.tryc.on.ca/php3.html">http://www.tryc.on.ca/php3.html</A>.

<HR>

<H2>Obtaining PHP3</H2>

<H3>Where can I obtain PHP3?</H3>

<P>You can download PHP3 from any of the members of the
PHP3 network of sites. These can be found at <A
href="http://www.php.net/">http://www.php.net/</A>.

<H3>Why do I have to register to download PHP3?</H3>

<P>This is so the development team can find out what operating systems
and databases that people are using, and how many people are using PHP3
in general. Don't worry, you aren't being added to any mailing lists
by registering!

<H3>Where can I get libraries needed to compile some of the optional
PHP3 extensions?</H3>

<p>Those marked with * are not thread-safe libraries, and should not be
used with a server module under the windows environment.  This does not matter
on the unix environment.</p>

<H3>How do I get these libraries to work?</H3>

<P>You will need to follow instructions provided with the library.

<H3>Are pre-compiled binary versions available?</H3>

<P>Yes, as long as you're looking for binaries for Windows 95 or NT.
They're available in the same place as the source.

<HR>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>To install PHP3, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file located
in the distribution. Windows 95 and NT users should also read the
README.WIN32 file.

<H3>Common Problems</H3>

<DL>
  <DT><B>
    I'm having problems configuring PHP3 to work with Apache. It says
    it can't find httpd.h, but it's right where I said it is!
  </B></DT>
  <DD>
    You need to tell the configure/setup script the location of the
    <EM>top-level</EM> of your Apache source tree. This means that
    you want to specify '<CODE>--with-apache=/path/to/apache</CODE>'
    and <EM>not</EM> '<CODE>--with-apache=/path/to/apache/src</CODE>'.
  <P>
  </DD>
  <DT><b>
    When I run configure, it says that it can't find the include files or
    library for gdbm (or some other package)!
  </b></DT>
  <DD>
    You can make the configure script looks for header files and libraries
    in non-standard locations by specifying additional flags to pass to
    the C compiler, such as:
    <PRE>
            CFLAGS=-I/path/to/include LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/library ./configure
    </PRE>
    If you're using a csh-variant for your login shell (why?), it would be:
    <PRE>
            env CFLAGS=-I/path/to/include LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/library ./configure
    </PRE>
  <P>
  </DD>

  <DT><b>
    When it is compiling the file language-parser.tab.c, it gives me errors
    that say 'yytname undeclared'.
  </b></DT>
  <DD>
    You need to update your version of Bison.
  <P>
  </DD>
            
  <DT><b>
    When I run 'make', it seems to run fine but then fails when it tries
    to link the final application complaining that it can't find some files.
  </b></DT>
  <DD>
    Some old versions of make that don't correctly put the compiled
    versions of the files in the functions directory into that same
    directory. Try running "<CODE>cp *.o functions</CODE>" and then
    re-running 'make' to see if that helps. If it does, you should really
    upgrade to a recent version of GNU make.
  <P>
  </DD>

  <DT><b>
    When linking PHP3, it complains about a number of undefined references.
  </b></DT>
  <DD>
    Take a look at the link line and make sure that all of the appropriate
    libraries are being included at the end. Common ones that you might have
    missed are '-ldl' and any libraries required for any database support
    you included.
    <P>
    If you're linking with Apache 1.2.x, did you remember to add the
    appropriate information to the EXTRA_LIBS line of the Configuration
    file and re-rerun Apache's Configure script? See the INSTALL file that
    comes with the distribution for more information.
    <P>
    Some people have reported that they had to add '-ldl' immediately
    following 'libphp3.a' when linking with Apache.
  <P>

<H2>Using PHP3</H2>

<H3>Common Problems</H3>

<DL>
  <DT><b>
    I installed PHP3, but every time I load a document, I get the
    message 'Document Contains No Data'! What's going on here?
  </b></DT>
  <DD>
    This probably means that PHP3 is having some sort of problem
    and is core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if
    this is the case, and then try to reproduce the problem with
    a small test case. If you know how to use 'gdb', it is very
    helpful when you can provide a backtrace with your bug report
    to help the developers pinpoint the problem.
    <P>
    If your script using the regular expression functions (<CODE>ereg()</CODE>
    and friends), you should make sure that you compiled PHP3 and
    Apache with the same regular expression package. (This should
    happen automatically with PHP3 and Apache 1.3.)
  <P>
  </DD>
  <DT><B>
    I'm trying to access one of the standard CGI variables (such
    as $DOCUMENT_ROOT or $HTTP_REFERER) in a user-defined function,
    and it can't seem to find it. What's wrong?
  </B></DT>
  <DD>
    Environment variables are now normal global variables, so you must
    either declare them as global variables in your function (by using
    "<CODE>global $DOCUMENT_ROOT;</CODE>", for example) or by using
    the global variable array (ie, "<CODE>$GLOBALS["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]</CODE>".
  <P>
  </DD>
</DL>

<H3>I think I found a bug! Who should I tell?</H3>

<P>You should use the bug-reporting form located on any
of the PHP3 network members. For example, try going to <A
href="http://www.php.net/bug-form.php3">http://www.php.net/bug-form.php3</A>.

<H2>Migrating from PHP/FI 2.0</H2>

<H3>Common Problems</H3>

<DL>
  <DT><b>
    I converted my script from PHP/FI 2.0 to PHP3 syntax, but now it just
    hangs! When I looked at the processes running on my server, there was
    one process that was chewing up all of the CPU cycles!
  </b></DT>
  <DD>
    You probably missed the semi-colon on a <CODE>while
    (condition);</CODE> statement. This will cause PHP3 to spin out of
    control because it is simply executing an empty body for your while
    loop!  Change the semi-colon to a colon and it should work correctly.
  <P>
  </DD>
  <DT><B>
    My user-functions don't work any more! I get a "Parse error (expecting '('"
    on the first line of the function.
  </B></DT>
  <DD>
    PHP3's function declaration now resembles C function declarations, so
    your function should look like:
    <PRE>
        function printsum($a, $b) {
           echo $a + $b;
        }
    </PRE>
    <P>You can also use old-style function declarations by use the 
    'old_function' designation, like so:
    <PRE>
        old_function printsum $a, $b (
           echo $a + $b;
        );
    </PRE>
    <P>
    </DD>
