        PHP is proud to announce TestFest 2010. TestFest is PHP's annual campaign
        to increase the overall code coverage of PHP through PHPT tests. During
        TestFest, PHP User Groups and individuals around the world organize local
        events where new tests are written and new contributors are introduced to
        PHP's testing suite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year was very successful with 887 tests submitted and a code coverage
        increase of 2.5%. This year we hope to do better.
      </p>
      <p>
        TestFest's own SVN repository and reporting tools are back online for this
        year's event. New to TestFest this year are automated test environment build
        tools as well as screencasts showing those build tools in action.
      </p>
