    <p>PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 do not fix all variations of the CGI issues described
    in CVE-2012-1823. It has also come to our attention that some sites use
    an insecure cgiwrapper script to run PHP. These scripts will use $*
    instead of "$@" to pass parameters to php-cgi which causes a number of
    issues.

    <p>Another set of releases is planed for Tuesday, May, 8th. These
    releases will fix the CGI flaw and another issue in
    apache_request_header (5.4 only).</p>

    <p>However, we recommend to anyone affected with the CGI flaw to migrate
    to FastCGI and FPM (or another SAPI like mod_php). CGI is a very old
    technology and is really not aimed to be used in today's production
    server.</p>

    <p>We apologize for the inconvenience created with these releases and the
    (lack of) communications around them.</p>
