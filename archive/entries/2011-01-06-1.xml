     The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
     availability of PHP <a href="http://www.php.net/releases/5_3_5.php">5.3.5</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_17.php">5.2.17</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     This release resolves a critical issue, reported as PHP bug #53632,
     where conversions from string to double might cause the PHP interpreter
     to hang on systems using x87 FPU registers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The problem is known to only affect x86 32-bit PHP processes, regardless
     of whether the system hosting PHP is 32-bit or 64-bit. You can test
     whether your system is affected by running <a href="/distributions/test_bug53632.txt">this script</a>
     from command line.
    </p>
    <p>
     All users of PHP are strongly advised to update to these versions
     immediately.
