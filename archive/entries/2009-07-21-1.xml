     The <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk">PHP North West
     Conference</a> has announced its return for a second year, to be held
     on Saturday 10th October 2009 in Manchester, UK.  This is a one-day
     conference aimed at developers from the local region and further
     afield, with a deliberately low ticket price to ensure everyone who
     wants to attend can do so.  We combine experienced speakers with some
     new local talent to bring an event that truly has something for
     everyone and a great buzz.
     </p>
     <p>
     The official conference is on the Saturday but there are social events
     on Friday and Saturday and an informal schedule on Sunday, so come and
     make a weekend of it with us in Manchester!  All the venues are in
     central Manchester and walkable from mainline public transport, so do
     join us.
     </p>
     <p>
     There is a call for papers which runs until 16th August 2009 and the
     early bird ticket prices are fixed until September 10th.  For more
     information, to submit a paper, to buy tickets, or to contact the
     organisers please visit the <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk">conference website</a>.
