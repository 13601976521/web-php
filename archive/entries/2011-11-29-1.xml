        The PHP development team is proud to announce the second 
        <a href="http://qa.php.net">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4.
        PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy 
        (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the 
        <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the second release candidate. The release candidate phase is intended as 
        a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release. No new features should
        be included before the final version of PHP 5.4.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Changes since the previous release candidate include:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Further bug fixes in the built-in web server.</li>
        <li>PHP-FPM is no longer marked as EXPERIMENTAL.</li>
        <li>Several improvements and bug fixes in the Zend Engine, Core and other extensions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
