        The <a href="http://phpcon.org/">PHP Community Conference</a> is
        a conference by and for the PHP community. It's for people who care
        about PHP and what they make with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by conferences like <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/">Webstock</a>
        and <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/">Brooklyn Beta</a>, we want
        to make a friendly conference for us. Together with our friends and
        peers, we (<a href="http://twitter.com/ramsey">Ben</a>,
        <a href="http://twitter.com/lisamusing">Lisa</a>, and
        <a href="http://twitter.com/NickASloan">Nick</a>) aim to inspire you
        to make great things with PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The PHP Community Conference is a two-day event, taking place April
        21st and 22nd, 2011 in Nashville, TN. We have an
        <a href="http://phpcon.org/speakers">awesome line-up of speakers</a>,
        including a keynote address by <strong>Rasmus Lerdorf</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll kick things off with a tutorial day that will introduce you
        to tools and ideas that you can use in your code right away. The
        second day will consist of presentations that will inspire you to
        create something new with PHP. With the help of our sponsors, we
        are able to offer admission to the entire event for $350 USD. We'll
        provide lunch and snacks on both days. On Friday night, we'll
        finish off the conference with a party featuring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">pecha kucha</a>
        talks by our awesome attendees.
