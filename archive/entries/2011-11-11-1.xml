      The PHP development team is proud to announce the first 
      <a href="http://qa.php.net/">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4. 
      PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy 
      (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the 
      <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      This is the first release candidate. No new features will be included 
      before the final version of PHP 5.4.0. The release candidate phase is 
      intended as a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release.
     </p>

        <li>Changed silent conversion of array to string to produce a notice.</li>
        <li>Numerous bug fixes and improvements in the Core and other extensions.</li>
      </ul>
     <p>
