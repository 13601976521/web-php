       The PHP development team is proud to announce the 4th
       <a href="http://qa.php.net">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4.
       PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy
       (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the
       <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong>THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>.
     </p>
     <p>
       This is the third release candidate. The release candidate phase is intended as
       a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release. No new features should
       be included before the final version of PHP 5.4.0.
     </p>
     <p>
       The new release candidate fixed several bugs, including:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>Added max_input_vars directive to prevent attacks based on hash collisions</li>
       <li>Fixed a segfault in the traits code</li>
     </ul>
     <p>

       file for a complete list of changes in this release.
     </p>
     <p>
       Please continue to help us to identify bugs in order to ensure that the release is
       solid and all things behave as expected.  Please test this release candidate
       against your code base and report any problems that you encounter to the
       <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailing list</a> and/or the
       <a href="https://bugs.php.net/">PHP bug tracker</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
       The next release candidate will be released in 14 days.
