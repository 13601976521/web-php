     <p>The <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw11/">PHP North West
     conference</a> returns in 2011 with the usual great selection of
     technical content for you to enjoy!</p>
     <p>
     We're at Ramada Hotel on Picadilly Gardens right in the centre of
     Manchester on October 8th and 9th (Saturday and Sunday) with some
     excellent talks.  For those looking for more in-depth technical
     learning, we're adding a tutorial day this year; join us on Friday 7th
     October for a full day of workshop format sessions with industry
     leaders - and every ticket includes a pass to the main conference!
     </p>
     <p>
     Our call for papers runs until June 12th 2011, and whether you join us
     as a speaker, a sponsor, or an attendee, we know you'll have a great
     time.  PHPNW is a fun weekend of PHP and technology with an excellent
     crowd to hang out with - hope to see you there :)
