     <p>The wiki.php.net box was compromised and the attackers were able to
     collect wiki account credentials. No other machines in the php.net
     infrastructure appear to have been affected. Our biggest concern is,
     of course, the integrity of our source code. We did an extensive code
     audit and looked at every commit since 5.3.5 to make sure that no stolen
     accounts were used to inject anything malicious. Nothing was found.
     The compromised machine has been wiped and we are forcing a password
     change for all svn accounts.</p>
     
     <p>We are still investigating the details of the attack which combined a
     vulnerability in the Wiki software with a Linux root exploit.</p>
