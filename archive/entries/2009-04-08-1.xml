      <p>The PHP Development Team would like to announce the availability of a new Windows build for PHP - PHP 5.2.9-2</p>
      <p>This release focuses on fixing security flaws in the included OpenSSL library (CVE-2009-0590, CVE-2009-0591 and CVE-2009-0789). The security advisory is available <a href="http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Note: Only the Windows binaries are affected. There are no changes to the PHP sources, therefore no source releases are necessary.</p>
