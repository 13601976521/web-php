     <p>The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
     availability of PHP 5.3.6. This release focuses on improving the
     stability of the PHP 5.3.x branch with over 60 bug fixes, some of which
     are security related.</p>

     </ul>
     
     <p>Windows users: please mind that we do no longer provide builds created
     with Visual Studio C++ 6. It is impossible to maintain a high quality
     and safe build of PHP for Windows using this unmaintained compiler.
     </p>
     
     <p>For Apache SAPIs (php5_apache2_2.dll), be sure that you use a Visual
     Studio C++ 9 version of Apache. We recommend the PHP builds as provided
     by <a href="http://www.apachelounge.com/">ApacheLounge</a>. For any other SAPI (CLI,
     FastCGI via mod_fcgi, FastCGI with IIS or other FastCGI capable
     server), everything works as before. Third party extension providers
     must rebuild their extensions to make them compatible and loadable with
     the Visual Studio C++9 builds that we now provide.
     </p>
     
     <p>All PHP users should note that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported anymore. All users
     are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.6.</p>
