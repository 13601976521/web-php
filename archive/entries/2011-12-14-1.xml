        The PHP development team is proud to announce the third
        <a href="http://qa.php.net">release candidate</a> of PHP 5.4.
        PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy 
        (deprecated) behaviours. Windows binaries can be downloaded from the 
        <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows QA site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the third release candidate. The release candidate phase is intended as 
        a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release. No new features should
        be included before the final version of PHP 5.4.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Changes since the previous release candidate include:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The intl extension now supports UTS #46 mapping for IDNA</li>
        <li>$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] and $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] are now available in the builtin CLI server implementation.</li>
        <li>Several improvements and bug fixes in the Zend Engine, Core and other extensions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
