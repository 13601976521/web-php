        PHP London are pleased to announce the date, venue and registration availability
        of their 5th annual UK PHP conference, building on the success of previous events
        and accommodating the continual growth of the PHP community and PHP development
        industry.

        The event takes place on <abbr title="2009-02-26" class="dtstart">Friday 26th February 2010</abbr>
