<h1>Unsubscribing From a Mailing List</h1>

<p>All of the mailing lists hosted at <a
href="http://lists.php.net/">lists.php.net</a> are managed using the <a
href="http://www.ezmlm.org/">ezmlm-idx</a> mailing list software.</p>

<p><b>If the mailing list you would like to unsubscribe from is listed
in the list on our <a href="/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists page</a>,
then you don't need to use your mail client to unsubscribe, you can do
so on the web, using the form on the page.</b> If you still need to find
out what email address you used to subscribe, the instructions on this
page can help.</p>

<p>First off, if your email address has changed since you subscribed, don't
panic! If you are still able to receive mail at your old email address, you can
still unsubscribe without having to wait for someone to do it manually! An
explanation of how to unsubscribe an email address other than your current one
from the mailing lists is located <a href="#unsubdiff">further below</a>.</p>

<p>To unsubscribe from one of those mailing lists, all you usually need to do is
send an email to <tt><em>listname</em>-unsubscribe@lists.php.net</tt>
(substituting the name of the list for <tt><em>listname</em></tt> &mdash; for
example, <tt>php-general-unsubscribe@lists.php.net</tt>).</p>

<p>If you are subscribed to the <b>digest version</b> of the mailing list, you
need to send an email to
<tt><em>listname</em>-digest-unsubscribe@lists.php.net</tt>.</p>

<p>You will get an automated response with further instructions on how to
unsubscribe from the list. (You are not simply unsubscribed immediately so that
someone can't unsubscribe other people from the list without their consent.)</p>

<p>If you get a reply that says you are not subscribed to the mailing list, but
you are receiving mailing list traffic, it may be because your email is now
coming from a different address than when you first subscribed. (This is
determined using the SMTP "envelope sender", <strong>not</strong> the 'From:'
or any other header in your email. So you may not have changed anything, it may
have been a change to your mail server or at your ISP.)</p>

<p>To determine what email address is subscribed to the mailing list that you
are receiving the messages from, you'll need to inspect the headers of one of
those messages. The email address will be encoded in the 'Return-Path' header
with the @-sign replaced with an equals (=) sign.  For example, if the
subscribed email address is <tt>joecool@example.com</tt>, the 'Return-Path'
header will look something like:</p>

<pre>
  Return-Path: &lt;php-general-return-1234-joecool=example.com@lists.php.net&gt;
</pre>

<div class="tip">
<p>If you use <a href="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</a>, you can view the
full headers of a message by clicking on the 'Blah Blah Blah' toolbar button
above the message.</p>
<p>If you use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/">Microsoft
Outlook</a>, you can view the full headers of a message by either clicking on
the 'Options' tab (Outlook 97) or selecting the 'Options...' item from the
'View' menu. The headers are displayed at the bottom of the resulting
window.</p>
<p>If you use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/oe/">Microsoft Outlook
Express</a>, you can view the full headers of a message by selecting
'Properties' from the 'File' menu and then clicking on the 'Details' tab.</p>
<p>If you use <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>, you can view the full
headers of a message by typing 'h' in the message or list view (or whatever key
you have bound to the 'display-toggle-weed' function).</p>
<p>If you use <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape Messenger 4.x</a>, you can view the full headers of a
message by selecting 'Headers&rarr;All' from the 'View' menu.</p>
<!-- need instructions on how to view full headers in various mail programs, particuarly online services like yahoo.com and hotmail.com -->
</div>

<p>To <a name="unsubdiff">unsubscribe an address like this that is
different</a> from what the mailing list software recognizes as your own
address, you need to send mail to
<tt><em>listname</em>-unsubscribe-<em>joecool=example.com</em>@lists.php.net</tt> (or
<tt>-unsubscribe-digest-</tt>, if the address is subscribed to the digest format
of the list).</p>

<p>Once you have done that, you will receive a message at that email address
with instructions on how to complete your unsubscription request.</p>

<p>If you are receiving mail from one of the mailing lists, there should be
absolutely no reason that you would be unable to unsubscribe yourself from the
list, except for your ability to follow these directions. However, if you find
yourself unable to unsubscribe from the mailing list, send an email to
<tt>php-list-admin@lists.php.net</tt>. Make sure to include the <strong>complete</strong>
headers from one of the messages you have received from the mailing list. Keep
in mind that there's a human being at the other end of that last email address,
so you'll have to be patient.</p>
