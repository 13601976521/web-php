<h1>European Open Source Development Threatened!</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[27-Aug-2003]</span>
 Today sees an international day of protest against the move by the EU to
 make obtaining a patent easier within Europe. Such patents may cause Open
 Source software such as PHP to infringe on existing licenses and new ones, 
 meaning we would no longer be safe to distribute PHP within Europe. Contact
 your EU Representative to get this cruicial vote blocked. Find out more at

<h1>PHP.net news history</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[15-Aug-2003]</span>
 Ever wonder what was the original PHP 3.0 release announcement, what
 where the choices when the PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor name was
 choosen, or since when you can use URL shortcuts to access pieces
 of our site? We have digged up some of the most interesting news
 items published on PHP.net since January 1998, when the site started
 to serve its visitors. You can find these <a href="/news-2003.php">in

<h1>Select mirror for redirection</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[13-Aug-2003]</span>
 The www.php.net site tries to do the best to choose close mirrors based
 on all available data when redirecting users to mirror sites. Sometimes
 close mirror sites are unfortunately not the fastest. This is why we have
 added the mirror site selection possibility to <a href="/my.php">our My
 PHP.net service</a>, which enables users to select a specific mirror
 site for redirections.

<h1>URL Shortcuts and Site Search</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[29-Jul-2003]</span>
 After many of our users requested a change in how
 <a href="/urlhowto.php">our URL shortcuts</a> behave when someone mistypes
 a shortcut, the default behaviour now is to look for a function name
 instead of performing a documentation search on Google. Those, who were
 satisfied with the Google search, can <a href="/my.php">set their
 preference at the My PHP.net page</a>. We are working on a better
 onsite search solution, Google is used temporarily to search our site.

<h1>Automatic Mirror Select</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[23-May-2003]</span>
 In our ongoing battle to fight load and keep serving you content, whenever you
 perform a search on www.php.net, you will be redirected onto a nearby mirror
 (determined using the <a href="http://www.directi.com/?site=ip-to-country">Directi
 Ip-to-Country Database</a>). 
 You may experience a few quirks in the search until your mirrors have synced an up-to-date
 version of the site.
</p>

<hr />

<h1>Country Detection</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[04-May-2003]</span>
 We are proud to introduce you the latest addition to our <a href="/my.php">My
 PHP.net</a> service. The PHP.net site and mirror sites now autodetect
 your country using the <a href="http://www.directi.com/?site=ip-to-country">Directi
 Ip-to-Country Database</a>. We use this information to present events in
 your country in bold letters on the frontpage, and to offer close mirror
 sites for downloads and your usual daily work.
</p>

<hr />

<h1>My PHP.net</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[24-Apr-2003]</span>
 The PHP website and mirrors sites now have a
 '<a href="/my.php">My PHP.net</a>' page, which allows
 you to check what language settings you have, and enables
 you to set one which will override all the other detected
 parameters.
</p>

<p>
 However, normally this is not needed, as we remember the
 language you used last time. Be sure to have cookies turned
 on for PHP.net to let this feature work!

<h1>Grant Program</h1>

 <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a>, is proud to
 announce the creation of the php|architect Grant Program, whose goal is
 to provide financial support to best-of-breed PHP-related projects.
</p>

<p>
 Participation in the program is open to all open-source projects
 that are related to PHP (but not necessarily written <i>in</i> PHP). The
 program is accepting submissions now and will start distributing grants
 in June of 2003.
</p>

<p>
 For more information, visit the <a 
 href="http://www.phparch.com/grant/">program's website</a>.

<h1>Set your own language preference</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[01-Mar-2003]</span>
 Starting from today, your browser's "Accept Language" setting is also
 honored on language sensitive pages on the php.net site. If you would
 like to get to the documentation page of echo for example, you can use
 the <a href="/echo">/echo</a> shortcut on all mirror sites, if your
 browser is set to provide your language preference information to the
 server. This also makes the PHP error message links point to the
 documentation in your preferred language.
</p>

<p>
 You can set your preferences under Edit/Preferences/Navigator/Languages
 in Mozilla, and under Tools/Internet Options/Languages in Internet
 Explorer. This will probably also enhance your web experience on sites
 providing translated content.
