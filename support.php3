<h3>Documentation</h3>
A good place to start is by skimming through the ever-growing <a
href="/FAQ.php3">FAQ</a>.  Then have a look at the online manual and
other resources in the <a href="/docs.php3">documentation</a> section.

<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3> If you can't resolve your problem from the
available documentation or mailing list archives, and you think it might
be a bug, a <a href="http://ca.php.net/bugs.php3">Bug Database</a> has
been established for tracking bugs and ensuring that all reported bugs
get addressed.  If you see a problem, please tell us so we can address it.

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
One of the best resources is a very friendly and helpful mailing
lists.  There are a couple of PHP-related mailing lists available.
The main list for PHP3 is: <b>php3@lists.php.net</b>.  You may
subscribe to this list by sending a blank message to <a href="mailto:
php3-subscribe@lists.php.net">php3-subscribe@lists.php.net</a>.
Archives for this list can be found at: 
<ul>
<li><a href = "http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=php-dev#php-dev">Developers' List</a>
<li><a href="http://www.progressive-comp.com/Lists/?l=php3-general#php3-general">PHP3 List (Nice interface)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.tryc.on.ca/php3.html">PHP3 List (going back further than the above)</a>
</ul>
<b>Warning:</b> The PHP3 mailing list gets close to 2500 messages per month currently.  Do the math.  
That translates to about 80 messages per day.  If your mailbox can't handle this sort of traffic you 
might want to consider reading the mailing list on the above web interface, or if you like reading
things with a news reader, you can read it at <a href="news://news.netimages.com/php3.general">news.netimages.com</a>.
<P> If you are interested in helping out with the
