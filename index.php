<h3>What is PHP?</h3>
<p>
 <acronym title="recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
 is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
 especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

<h1>PHP 4.4.0 Released</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[11-Jul-2005]</span>
 The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of 
 <a href="/downloads.php#v4">PHP 4.4.0</a>. 
 This is a maintenance release that addresses a serious memory corruption
 problem within PHP concerning references. If references were used in a wrong
 way, PHP could create memory corruptions which would not always surface or
 be visible. The increased middle digit was required because the fix that
 corrected the problem with references changed PHP's internal API, breaking
 binary compatibility with the PHP 4.3.* series. PHP 4.4.0 does not have
 any new features, and is solely a bugfix release; however, it is strongly
 recommended that you read the more detailed release announcement
 <a href="release_4_4_0.php">available here</a> prior to upgrading your
 PHP 4 installation.
</p>
<p>
For changes in PHP 4.4.0 since PHP 4.3.11, please consult the
<a href="/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.0">PHP 4 ChangeLog</a>.
</p>

<hr />

<h1>PEAR XML_RPC Vulnerability and PHP 4.4.0RC2 release</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[01-Jul-2005]</span>
 An easily exploitable security issue was discovered in PEAR XML_RPC &lt;=
 1.3.0.  We recommend that users of this PEAR class immediately upgrade to the
 latest version with:
</p>
<pre>
 pear upgrade XML_RPC
</pre>
<p>
 The same security problem exists in many other XML RPC implementations,
 please check if the installed applications that you use might have a
 similar problem.
</p>
<p>
 The new PEAR XML_RPC package is also bundled with the second release
 candidation of PHP 4.4.0RC2. Besides this new PEAR package there are two
 minor issues fixed since PHP 4.4.0RC1. As the improved reference support
 in PHP 4.4 might show as notices and warnings in your existing
 applications - in cases where PHP formerly just silently ignored this
 and often causing memory corruptions - we also recommend to test PHP
 4.4.0RC2 with your applications. The final release is planned for July
 11th. PHP 4.4.0RC2 can be found <a href="http://qa.php.net/~derick/">here</a>.
</p>
