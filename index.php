<h1> PHP 4.3.6RC1 released!</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[02-Apr-2004]</span>
In the spirit of release early, release often here is the first and hopefully the final
<a href="http://qa.php.net/">release candidate of PHP 4.3.6</a>. This release addresses
2 major bugs introduced in the 4.3.5 release. One of these bugs caused problems when 
loading dynamic extensions on Windows and thread-safe (ZTS) builds and the other involves
incorrect handling of daylight savings time. A few other minor bugs were fixed as well.
</p>

<h1>PHP 5 Release Candidate 1 Released!</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[18-Mar-2004]</span>
 The <a href="/downloads.php#v5">first Release Candidate of PHP 5</a> is finally
 here!  The move from Beta stage to RC stage means that PHP 5 is now feature
 complete, and is quite stable - stable enough for everyone to start playing
 with.  Note that it is still <i>not</i> recommended for mission-critical
 use.
</p>

<p>Some of the key features of PHP 5 include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  The <a href="http://www.zend.com/php5/zend-engine2.php">Zend Engine II</a>
  with a new object model and dozens of new features.
 </li>
 <li>
  XML support has been completely redone in PHP 5, all extensions are now
  focused around the excellent libxml2 library
  (<a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/">http://www.xmlsoft.org/</a>).
 </li>
 <li>
  A new MySQL extension named MySQLi for developers using MySQL 4.1 and later.
  This new extension includes an object-oriented interface in addition to
  a traditional interface; as well as support for many of MySQL's new features,
  such as prepared statements.
 </li>
 <li>
  SQLite has been bundled with PHP. For more information on SQLite,
  please visit <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">their website</a>.
 </li>
 <li>
  A brand new built-in SOAP extension for interoperability with Web Services.
 </li>
 <li>
  A new SimpleXML extension for easily accessing and manipulating XML as
  PHP objects. It can also interface with the DOM extension and vice-versa.
 </li>
 <li>
  Streams have been greatly improved, including the ability to access
  low-level socket operations on streams.
 </li>
 <li>And lots more...</li>
</ul>
