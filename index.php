<h2>What is PHP?</h2>
<P>
PHP is a server-side, cross-platform, HTML embedded scripting language.  
If you are completely new to PHP and want to get some idea of how it works, 
have a look at the <a href="tut.php">Introductory Tutorial</a>.  Once you get
beyond that have a look at the example archive sites and some of the other
resources available in the <a href="links.php">Links</a> section.

<h2>So, how much does it cost?</h2>
<P>
This may sound a little foreign to all you folks coming from a non-Unix
background, but PHP doesn't cost anything.  You can use it for commercial
and/or non-commercial use all you want.  You can give it to your friends,
print it out and hang it on your wall or eat it for lunch.  Welcome to
the world of <a href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</a> software!
