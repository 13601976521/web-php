<h1>Goal #1</h1>

<p>Seperate the code from the design.

<h2>Why?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Helps to break things into manageable components.
<li>Makes reuse of code and design elements easier.
<li>Makes it easier to use page-editing tools that are confused
by code.
<li>With large teams, this allows the designers to design, and the
programmers to program.
</ul>
