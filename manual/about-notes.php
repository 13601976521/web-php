<p>
The manual notes interface allows you to add notes to the online
version of the PHP manual. These notes are then shared with other
PHP users when they browse the manual online.
</p>

<p>
Periodically, the developers may go through the notes and incorporate
the information in them into the documentation. This also means, that
notes are always under the same license, as the manual itself.
</p>

<p>
These notes are <b>not</b> the place to report <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bugs</a>!
