* sprintf crashes with hard-limited string width combined with
  alignment (%-.20s)
* String in eval() is either not efree()'d, or both efree()'d and free()'d.
  It's allocated using e*() functions, but may be free()'d by flex, and later free()'d by the memory
  manager.  Another alternative is that it's not free()'d by flex, and is only free()'d by the
  memory manager, which is just a simple leak.
* split() function doesn't return regex errors nicely
* ksort() may contain a bug that causes PHP to get stuck and consume 100% CPU
* Configuration file strings are kinda broken
